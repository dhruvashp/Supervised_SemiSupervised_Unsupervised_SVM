# Supervised_SemiSupervised_Unsupervised_SVM

The above set of codes were written to perform Supervised, Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised learning using SVM (and a score of other ML techniques), and a comparison was also deliberated of these various techniques using various comparsion parameters

This was done as part of course DSCI 552, taken at USC, under Prof. Rajati, in Fall 2020

I coded it in Fall 2020, but commited it again in a Public Repository again, organized, in Spring 2021
